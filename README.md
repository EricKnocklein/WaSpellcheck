# WaSpellcheck

This is an extension to enable spellcheck on the World Anvil Plato editor. To use it, download `enable.js` and `manifest.json` into a folder by themselves (I suggest cloning the repo), go to `chrome://extensions`, enable `Developer mode` in the top right, click `Load unpacked`, and select the folder with the downloaded files. This will import the extension, and it should be enabled by default.
